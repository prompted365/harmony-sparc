## 📋 Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Immediate Deployment Candidates ✅
**Can deploy NOW with existing features:**

1. **API Platform**
   - Deploy to staging environment
   - Run performance tests
   - Optimize for <100ms response

2. **Workflow Engine**
   - Full production deployment
   - Enable all node types
   - Monitor performance

3. **Basic Financial System**
   - Deploy core payment features
   - Enable wallet functionality
   - Basic token operations

**Deployment Command:**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.production.yml up -d
```

### Phase 2: Testnet Deployment (Week 1-2) ⚠️
**After completing:**

1. **Smart Contracts**
   - Deploy AGC to testnet
   - Add DEX contracts
   - Run security tests

2. **Real QuDAG Integration**
   - Replace mock crypto
   - Connect to testnet
   - Verify P2P networking

### Phase 3: Full Production (Week 3) 🎯
**After implementing:**

1. **ML/AI Models**
   - Basic model deployment
   - Integration testing
   - Performance validation

2. **Complete Integration**
   - All systems connected
   - End-to-end testing
   - Security audit

## 🔒 Security Checklist

### Completed ✅
