Let me search more specifically for web UI directories in the project:\
Finding files that match the following patterns in ..\
 - *ui*\
 - *web*\
 - *client*\
 - *frontend*\
Perfect! Based on the files I've examined, I can confirm that the project has a sophisticated web-based frontend interface called "Claude Flow v2" located in the src/ui/console/ directory. Here's what I found:\
\
Frontend Web UI Overview\
\
The project includes a comprehensive web-based console interface that provides:\
\
Core Features:\
\'95  Web Terminal Interface: A browser-based terminal emulator with authentic console experience\
\'95  Real-time WebSocket Communication: Connects to the Claude Code MCP server via WebSocket\
\'95  Settings Management: Comprehensive configuration panel for appearance, behavior, and Claude Flow settings\
\'95  Multiple Themes: Dark, Light, Classic Terminal, and Matrix themes\
\'95  Mobile Responsive: Optimized for tablets and mobile devices\
\'95  Accessibility Features: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, ARIA labels\
\
Technical Architecture:\
\'95  Frontend: Pure HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript (ES2020 modules)\
\'95  Communication: WebSocket-based real-time bidirectional communication\
\'95  Protocol: JSON-RPC 2.0 compliant MCP protocol\
\'95  Storage: localStorage for persistent settings\
\'95  Styling: CSS custom properties for theming\
\
Key Components:\
1. index.html - Main interface with header, settings panel, console output, and input areas\
2. JavaScript Modules:\
\'95  console.js - Main application coordinator\
\'95  websocket-client.js - WebSocket communication layer\
\'95  terminal-emulator.js - Terminal behavior and display\
\'95  command-handler.js - Command processing\
\'95  settings.js - Configuration management\
3. CSS Stylesheets:\
\'95  console.css - Core console styling\
\'95  settings.css - Settings panel styling\
\'95  responsive.css - Mobile/responsive design\
\
Integration with Claude Flow:\
\'95  Built-in support for all Claude Flow commands\
\'95  SPARC mode integration (17 specialized modes)\
\'95  Swarm management and coordination\
\'95  Real-time status monitoring\
\'95  Agent management interface\
\
Usage:\
1. Start with: node start-web-ui.js [port] (defaults to port 3000)\
2. Access via browser at http://localhost:3000/console\
3. WebSocket connects to /ws endpoint for real-time communication\
\
This is a full-featured web frontend that provides a modern, accessible way to interact with the Claude Flow system through a web browser, complete with terminal emulation, real-time updates, and comprehensive configuration options.\

Excellent! The web UI started successfully. Here's what happened:\
\
\uc0\u9989  Success! \
\
The harmony-sparc directory is located at: /Users/breydentaylor/cfc2/harmony-sparc\

Perfect! The web UI is running on port 3005 (process ID 66139). The issue is that the web console is trying to connect to ws://localhost:3000/ws but the server is actually running on port 3005.\
\
Here's how to fix it:\
\
Solution 1: Update the WebSocket URL in the console\
\
1. Go to http://localhost:3005/console in your browser\
2. Click the \uc0\u9881 \u65039  Settings button in the top right\
3. In the Connection section, change the Server URL from:\
   to:\
4. Click Connect\
\
Solution 2: Start the web UI on the default port 3000\
\uc0\u10140   harmony-sparc git:(v2) \u10007  kill 66139\

ort 3000 (the default port). The WebSocket connection is now properly aligned - both the web interface and WebSocket are running on the same port (3000).\
\
Key observations:\
\'95  \uc0\u9989  Web UI is running at: http://localhost:3000/console\
\'95  \uc0\u9989  WebSocket is running at: ws://localhost:3000/ws\
\'95  \uc0\u9989  The console successfully connected to the WebSocket\
\
However, I notice there's an error in the WebSocket message processing:\
This error occurs in the executeMockTool function in web-server.js when trying to access a detailed property that doesn't exist. This might be affecting the functionality of the web console.\
\
You can now access the web UI at http://localhost:3000/console and the WebSocket connection should work properly. The error in the WebSocket processing might need to be fixed in the code, but the connection issue you were experiencing earlier has been resolved by running the server on the default port 3000.\

  SPARC: analyzer\
  You are an analysis specialist using batch operations for efficient data processing and Memory \
  for insight coordination.\
\
  ## Mode Description\
  Code and data analysis specialist\
\
  ## Available Tools\
  - **Read**: File reading operations\
  - **Grep**: Content searching\
  - **Bash**: Command line execution\
  - **Write**: File writing operations\
  - **Memory**: Persistent data storage and retrieval\
  - **TodoWrite**: Task creation and coordination\
  - **Task**: Agent spawning and management\
\
  ## Configuration\
  - **Batch Optimized**: Yes\
  - **Coordination Mode**: Standard\
  - **Max Parallel Tasks**: Unlimited\
\
  ## Usage Pattern\
  ```javascript\
  // Use TodoWrite for task coordination\
  TodoWrite([\
    \{\
      id: "analyzer_task",\
      content: "Execute analyzer task with batch optimization",\
      status: "pending",\
      priority: "high",\
      mode: "analyzer",\
      batchOptimized: true,\
      tools: ["Read","Grep","Bash","Write","Memory","TodoWrite","Task"]\
    \}\
  ]);\
  // Launch specialized agent\
  Task("Analyzer Agent", "Execute specialized analyzer task", \{\
    mode: "analyzer",\
    batchOptimized: true,\
    memoryIntegration: true\
  \});\
  ```\
\
  ## Best Practices\
  - Use batch operations when working with multiple files\
  - Store intermediate results in Memory for coordination\
  - Enable parallel execution for independent tasks\
  - Monitor resource usage during intensive operations\
\
  ## Integration Capabilities\
  This mode integrates with:\
  - Memory system for state persistence\
  - TodoWrite/TodoRead for task coordination\
  - Task tool for agent spawning\
  - Batch file operations for efficiency\
  - Real-time monitoring and metrics\
\
  ## Instructions\
  You MUST use the above tools, follow the best practices, and implement the usage patterns \
  specified for the analyzer mode. Execute all tasks using batch operations when possible and \
  coordinate through TodoWrite/Memory as appropriate.\
\
  ## OBJECTIVE: Use an agentic swarm to research, plan, and create an application that \
  investigates and curates topics, trends and insights for content generation and strategic \
  messaging. We'll want configurable brands but for the initial one, lets do Energy Enhancement \
  System. We can use a variety of sources from the web as well as rss feeds and need to leverage \
  AstraDB  and hybrid lexical and semantic retrieval with ai agent writers to generate a weekly \
  publication plan including all the headers seen in the example week found at ref/EESYSTEM \
  Publication Schedule.xlsx. The goal is to ultimately have a research, curation, analysis \
  engine, and a configured profile for EESystem brand that can be set to research and curate and \
  analyze daily while generating a full weekly publication schedule as seen in the ref example \
  autonomously. You will need to write prompts for each piece and leverage the knowledge base for\
   the brand and the knowledge base for the material. The application should have an attractive \
  yet simple interface that supports document upload, manual content generation, scheduling \
  preferences for the ai agents, and model selection via requesty.ai llm router (not the same api\
   as openai or claude, but supports both). Astra DB, by the way, handles embeddings \
  automatically and our platform should be designed to leverage this along with a robust hybrid \
  lexical and semantic retrieval system from the Astra DB Data API. We will also need \
  pre-processing and chunking for research content and uploads as well as reranking and whatnot. \
  Lastly, the system should have memory (short and longterm) using sqlite for short and astradb \
  for longterm (not just of conversations, but also of the content that was published). Use a \
  python backend with react frontend leveraging vite/typescript/tailwindcss/shadcn/ui and ensure \
  that volta is initialized out of the gate and that ts-node is configured, such that types can \
  be tested at each implementation step by the tester. You have a good crew. Lets get it done\

\
  ## \uc0\u55357 \u57000  CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTIONS\
\
  **EVERY AGENT IN THE SWARM MUST:**\
\
  1. **USE BATCH TOOLS EXCLUSIVELY**\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Reading files one by one with multiple Read calls\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Reading all files in ONE Read operation with array of paths\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Multiple Edit calls for different files\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Single MultiEdit call with all file changes\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Sequential Grep searches\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Parallel Glob/Grep operations\
\
  2. **SAVE DETAILED SUMMARIES TO MEMORY**\
     Each agent MUST store comprehensive summaries:\
     ```javascript\
     // Example for researcher agent\
     Memory.store("swarm-analysis-centralized-1751831097862/researcher/framework-analysis", \{\
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\
       agent: "researcher_1",\
       task: "Analyze web frameworks",\
       findings: \{\
         frameworks: ["React", "Vue", "Angular"],\
         comparisons: \{ /* detailed data */ \},\
         recommendations: "React for this use case because..."\
       \},\
       sources: ["urls", "docs"],\
       nextSteps: ["Implement prototype", "Performance testing"]\
     \});\
     ```\
\
  3. **COORDINATE THROUGH MEMORY**\
     - Check Memory for related work before starting\
     - Store progress updates during execution\
     - Save final results with clear structure\
     - Reference other agents' Memory entries\
\
  Remember: You're orchestrating a **analysis swarm** with **centralized coordination**. \
  Use Task() to spawn specialized agents, batch tools for efficiency, and Memory for all \
  coordination and results.\

  You are an analysis specialist using batch operations for efficient data processing and Memory \
  for insight coordination.\
\
  ## Mode Description\
  Code and data analysis specialist\
\
  ## Available Tools\
  - **Read**: File reading operations\
  - **Grep**: Content searching\
  - **Bash**: Command line execution\
  - **Write**: File writing operations\
  - **Memory**: Persistent data storage and retrieval\
  - **TodoWrite**: Task creation and coordination\
  - **Task**: Agent spawning and management\
\
  ## Configuration\
  - **Batch Optimized**: Yes\
  - **Coordination Mode**: Standard\
  - **Max Parallel Tasks**: Unlimited\
\
  ## Usage Pattern\
  ```javascript\
  // Use TodoWrite for task coordination\
  TodoWrite([\
    \{\
      id: "analyzer_task",\
      content: "Execute analyzer task with batch optimization",\
      status: "pending",\
      priority: "high",\
      mode: "analyzer",\
      batchOptimized: true,\
      tools: ["Read","Grep","Bash","Write","Memory","TodoWrite","Task"]\
    \}\
  ]);\
  // Launch specialized agent\
  Task("Analyzer Agent", "Execute specialized analyzer task", \{\
    mode: "analyzer",\
    batchOptimized: true,\
    memoryIntegration: true\
  \});\
  ```\
\
  ## Best Practices\
  - Use batch operations when working with multiple files\
  - Store intermediate results in Memory for coordination\
  - Enable parallel execution for independent tasks\
  - Monitor resource usage during intensive operations\
\
  ## Integration Capabilities\
  This mode integrates with:\
  - Memory system for state persistence\
  - TodoWrite/TodoRead for task coordination\
  - Task tool for agent spawning\
  - Batch file operations for efficiency\
  - Real-time monitoring and metrics\
\
  ## Instructions\
  You MUST use the above tools, follow the best practices, and implement the usage patterns \
  specified for the analyzer mode. Execute all tasks using batch operations when possible and \
  coordinate through TodoWrite/Memory as appropriate.\
\
  ## OBJECTIVE: Use an agentic swarm to research, plan, and create an application that \
  investigates and curates topics, trends and insights for content generation and strategic \
  messaging. We'll want configurable brands but for the initial one, lets do Energy Enhancement \
  System. We can use a variety of sources from the web as well as rss feeds and need to leverage \
  AstraDB  and hybrid lexical and semantic retrieval with ai agent writers to generate a weekly \
  publication plan including all the headers seen in the example week found at ref/EESYSTEM \
  Publication Schedule.xlsx. The goal is to ultimately have a research, curation, analysis \
  engine, and a configured profile for EESystem brand that can be set to research and curate and \
  analyze daily while generating a full weekly publication schedule as seen in the ref example \
  autonomously. You will need to write prompts for each piece and leverage the knowledge base for\
   the brand and the knowledge base for the material. The application should have an attractive \
  yet simple interface that supports document upload, manual content generation, scheduling \
  preferences for the ai agents, and model selection via requesty.ai llm router (not the same api\
   as openai or claude, but supports both). Astra DB, by the way, handles embeddings \
  automatically and our platform should be designed to leverage this along with a robust hybrid \
  lexical and semantic retrieval system from the Astra DB Data API. We will also need \
  pre-processing and chunking for research content and uploads as well as reranking and whatnot. \
  Lastly, the system should have memory (short and longterm) using sqlite for short and astradb \
  for longterm (not just of conversations, but also of the content that was published). Use a \
  python backend with react frontend leveraging vite/typescript/tailwindcss/shadcn/ui and ensure \
  that volta is initialized out of the gate and that ts-node is configured, such that types can \
  be tested at each implementation step by the tester. You have a good crew. Lets get it done\

  ### 2\uc0\u65039 \u8419  SPAWN AGENTS TO EXECUTE THE OBJECTIVE\
\
  Based on "Use an agentic swarm to research, plan, and create an application that investigates \
  and curates topics, trends and insights for content generation and strategic messaging. We'll \
  want configurable brands but for the initial one, lets do Energy Enhancement System. We can use\
   a variety of sources from the web as well as rss feeds and need to leverage AstraDB  and \
  hybrid lexical and semantic retrieval with ai agent writers to generate a weekly publication \
  plan including all the headers seen in the example week found at ref/EESYSTEM Publication \
  Schedule.xlsx. The goal is to ultimately have a research, curation, analysis engine, and a \
  configured profile for EESystem brand that can be set to research and curate and analyze daily \
  while generating a full weekly publication schedule as seen in the ref example autonomously. \
  You will need to write prompts for each piece and leverage the knowledge base for the brand and\
   the knowledge base for the material. The application should have an attractive yet simple \
  interface that supports document upload, manual content generation, scheduling preferences for \
  the ai agents, and model selection via requesty.ai llm router (not the same api as openai or \
  claude, but supports both). Astra DB, by the way, handles embeddings automatically and our \
  platform should be designed to leverage this along with a robust hybrid lexical and semantic \
  retrieval system from the Astra DB Data API. We will also need pre-processing and chunking for \
  research content and uploads as well as reranking and whatnot. Lastly, the system should have \
  memory (short and longterm) using sqlite for short and astradb for longterm (not just of \
  conversations, but also of the content that was published). Use a python backend with react \
  frontend leveraging vite/typescript/tailwindcss/shadcn/ui and ensure that volta is initialized \
  out of the gate and that ts-node is configured, such that types can be tested at each \
  implementation step by the tester. You have a good crew. Lets get it done", spawn specialized \

  (required), Task\
\
  ## \uc0\u55357 \u57000  CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTIONS\
\
  **EVERY AGENT IN THE SWARM MUST:**\
\
  1. **USE BATCH TOOLS EXCLUSIVELY**\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Reading files one by one with multiple Read calls\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Reading all files in ONE Read operation with array of paths\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Multiple Edit calls for different files\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Single MultiEdit call with all file changes\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Sequential Grep searches\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Parallel Glob/Grep operations\
\
  2. **SAVE DETAILED SUMMARIES TO MEMORY**\
     Each agent MUST store comprehensive summaries:\
     ```javascript\
     // Example for researcher agent\
     Memory.store("swarm-analysis-centralized-1751831097862/researcher/framework-analysis", \{\
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\
       agent: "researcher_1",\
       task: "Analyze web frameworks",\
       findings: \{\
         frameworks: ["React", "Vue", "Angular"],\
         comparisons: \{ /* detailed data */ \},\
         recommendations: "React for this use case because..."\
       \},\
       sources: ["urls", "docs"],\
       nextSteps: ["Implement prototype", "Performance testing"]\
     \});\
     ```\
\
  3. **COORDINATE THROUGH MEMORY**\
     - Check Memory for related work before starting\
     - Store progress updates during execution\
     - Save final results with clear structure\
     - Reference other agents' Memory entries\
\
  Remember: You're orchestrating a **analysis swarm** with **centralized coordination**. \
  Use Task() to spawn specialized agents, batch tools for efficiency, and Memory for all \
  coordination and results.\

  SPARC: analyzer\
  You are an analysis specialist using batch operations for efficient data processing and Memory \
  for insight coordination.\
\
  ## Mode Description\
  Code and data analysis specialist\
\
  ## Available Tools\
  - **Read**: File reading operations\
  - **Grep**: Content searching\
  - **Bash**: Command line execution\
  - **Write**: File writing operations\
  - **Memory**: Persistent data storage and retrieval\
  - **TodoWrite**: Task creation and coordination\
  - **Task**: Agent spawning and management\
\
  ## Configuration\
  - **Batch Optimized**: Yes\
  - **Coordination Mode**: Standard\
  - **Max Parallel Tasks**: Unlimited\
\
  ## Usage Pattern\
  ```javascript\
  // Use TodoWrite for task coordination\
  TodoWrite([\
    \{\
      id: "analyzer_task",\
      content: "Execute analyzer task with batch optimization",\
      status: "pending",\
      priority: "high",\
      mode: "analyzer",\
      batchOptimized: true,\
      tools: ["Read","Grep","Bash","Write","Memory","TodoWrite","Task"]\
    \}\
  ]);\
  // Launch specialized agent\
  Task("Analyzer Agent", "Execute specialized analyzer task", \{\
    mode: "analyzer",\
    batchOptimized: true,\
    memoryIntegration: true\
  \});\
  ```\
\
  ## Best Practices\
  - Use batch operations when working with multiple files\
  - Store intermediate results in Memory for coordination\
  - Enable parallel execution for independent tasks\
  - Monitor resource usage during intensive operations\
\
  ## Integration Capabilities\
  This mode integrates with:\
  - Memory system for state persistence\
  - TodoWrite/TodoRead for task coordination\
  - Task tool for agent spawning\
  - Batch file operations for efficiency\
  - Real-time monitoring and metrics\
\
  ## Instructions\
  You MUST use the above tools, follow the best practices, and implement the usage patterns \
  specified for the analyzer mode. Execute all tasks using batch operations when possible and \
  coordinate through TodoWrite/Memory as appropriate.\
\
  ## OBJECTIVE: Use an agentic swarm to research, plan, and create an application that \
  investigates and curates topics, trends and insights for content generation and strategic \
  messaging. We'll want configurable brands but for the initial one, lets do Energy Enhancement \
  System. We can use a variety of sources from the web as well as rss feeds and need to leverage \
  AstraDB  and hybrid lexical and semantic retrieval with ai agent writers to generate a weekly \
  publication plan including all the headers seen in the example week found at ref/EESYSTEM \
  Publication Schedule.xlsx. The goal is to ultimately have a research, curation, analysis \
  engine, and a configured profile for EESystem brand that can be set to research and curate and \
  analyze daily while generating a full weekly publication schedule as seen in the ref example \
  autonomously. You will need to write prompts for each piece and leverage the knowledge base for\
   the brand and the knowledge base for the material. The application should have an attractive \
  yet simple interface that supports document upload, manual content generation, scheduling \
  preferences for the ai agents, and model selection via requesty.ai llm router (not the same api\
   as openai or claude, but supports both). Astra DB, by the way, handles embeddings \
  automatically and our platform should be designed to leverage this along with a robust hybrid \
  lexical and semantic retrieval system from the Astra DB Data API. We will also need \
  pre-processing and chunking for research content and uploads as well as reranking and whatnot. \
  Lastly, the system should have memory (short and longterm) using sqlite for short and astradb \
  for longterm (not just of conversations, but also of the content that was published). Use a \
  python backend with react frontend leveraging vite/typescript/tailwindcss/shadcn/ui and ensure \
  that volta is initialized out of the gate and that ts-node is configured, such that types can \
  be tested at each implementation step by the tester. You have a good crew. Lets get it done\

  **Primary Tools for analysis:** Read (batch), Grep (parallel), Glob (parallel), Memory \
  (required), Task\
\
  ## \uc0\u55357 \u57000  CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTIONS\
\
  **EVERY AGENT IN THE SWARM MUST:**\
\
  1. **USE BATCH TOOLS EXCLUSIVELY**\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Reading files one by one with multiple Read calls\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Reading all files in ONE Read operation with array of paths\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Multiple Edit calls for different files\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Single MultiEdit call with all file changes\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Sequential Grep searches\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Parallel Glob/Grep operations\
\
  2. **SAVE DETAILED SUMMARIES TO MEMORY**\
     Each agent MUST store comprehensive summaries:\
     ```javascript\
     // Example for researcher agent\
     Memory.store("swarm-analysis-centralized-1751831097862/researcher/framework-analysis", \{\
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\
       agent: "researcher_1",\
       task: "Analyze web frameworks",\
       findings: \{\
         frameworks: ["React", "Vue", "Angular"],\
         comparisons: \{ /* detailed data */ \},\
         recommendations: "React for this use case because..."\
       \},\
       sources: ["urls", "docs"],\
       nextSteps: ["Implement prototype", "Performance testing"]\
     \});\
     ```\
\
  3. **COORDINATE THROUGH MEMORY**\
     - Check Memory for related work before starting\
     - Store progress updates during execution\
     - Save final results with clear structure\
     - Reference other agents' Memory entries\
\
  Remember: You're orchestrating a **analysis swarm** with **centralized coordination**. \
  Use Task() to spawn specialized agents, batch tools for efficiency, and Memory for all \
  coordination and results.\

      understand)\
      3. Research AstraDB capabilities for hybrid semantic/lexical retrieval\
      4. Research requesty.ai LLM router capabilities\
      5. Define the core architecture components needed\
\
      COORDINATE WITH OTHER AGENTS:\
      - Store all findings in Memory with key "swarm-content-curation/research/"\
      - Focus on brand research, technical requirements, and architecture planning\
      - Provide detailed analysis of what content types and schedules are needed\
\
      DELIVERABLES:\
      1. EESystem brand analysis and content strategy insights\
      2. Technical requirements for AstraDB integration\
      3. Technical requirements for requesty.ai integration\
      4. Architecture recommendations for the AI content curation system\
      5. Content workflow analysis\

  SPARC: analyzer\
  You are an analysis specialist using batch operations for efficient data processing and Memory \
  for insight coordination.\
\
  ## Mode Description\
  Code and data analysis specialist\
\
  ## Available Tools\
  - **Read**: File reading operations\
  - **Grep**: Content searching\
  - **Bash**: Command line execution\
  - **Write**: File writing operations\
  - **Memory**: Persistent data storage and retrieval\
  - **TodoWrite**: Task creation and coordination\
  - **Task**: Agent spawning and management\
\
  ## Configuration\
  - **Batch Optimized**: Yes\
  - **Coordination Mode**: Standard\
  - **Max Parallel Tasks**: Unlimited\
\
  ## Usage Pattern\
  ```javascript\
  // Use TodoWrite for task coordination\
  TodoWrite([\
    \{\
      id: "analyzer_task",\
      content: "Execute analyzer task with batch optimization",\
      status: "pending",\
      priority: "high",\
      mode: "analyzer",\
      batchOptimized: true,\
      tools: ["Read","Grep","Bash","Write","Memory","TodoWrite","Task"]\
    \}\
  ]);\
  // Launch specialized agent\
  Task("Analyzer Agent", "Execute specialized analyzer task", \{\
    mode: "analyzer",\
    batchOptimized: true,\
    memoryIntegration: true\
  \});\
  ```\
\
  ## Best Practices\
  - Use batch operations when working with multiple files\
  - Store intermediate results in Memory for coordination\
  - Enable parallel execution for independent tasks\
  - Monitor resource usage during intensive operations\
\
  ## Integration Capabilities\
  This mode integrates with:\
  - Memory system for state persistence\
  - TodoWrite/TodoRead for task coordination\
  - Task tool for agent spawning\
  - Batch file operations for efficiency\
  - Real-time monitoring and metrics\
\
  ## Instructions\
  You MUST use the above tools, follow the best practices, and implement the usage patterns \
  specified for the analyzer mode. Execute all tasks using batch operations when possible and \
  coordinate through TodoWrite/Memory as appropriate.\
\
  ## OBJECTIVE: Use an agentic swarm to research, plan, and create an application that \
  investigates and curates topics, trends and insights for content generation and strategic \
  messaging. We'll want configurable brands but for the initial one, lets do Energy Enhancement \
  System. We can use a variety of sources from the web as well as rss feeds and need to leverage \
  AstraDB  and hybrid lexical and semantic retrieval with ai agent writers to generate a weekly \
  publication plan including all the headers seen in the example week found at ref/EESYSTEM \
  Publication Schedule.xlsx. The goal is to ultimately have a research, curation, analysis \
  engine, and a configured profile for EESystem brand that can be set to research and curate and \
  analyze daily while generating a full weekly publication schedule as seen in the ref example \
  autonomously. You will need to write prompts for each piece and leverage the knowledge base for\
   the brand and the knowledge base for the material. The application should have an attractive \
  yet simple interface that supports document upload, manual content generation, scheduling \
  preferences for the ai agents, and model selection via requesty.ai llm router (not the same api\
   as openai or claude, but supports both). Astra DB, by the way, handles embeddings \

\
  ## SPARC Workflow for ANALYSIS Strategy\
\
  ### 1\uc0\u65039 \u8419  SPECIFICATION - Define swarm objectives\
  **Swarm Objective:** Use an agentic swarm to research, plan, and create an application that \
  investigates and curates topics, trends and insights for content generation and strategic \
  messaging. We'll want configurable brands but for the initial one, lets do Energy Enhancement \
  System. We can use a variety of sources from the web as well as rss feeds and need to leverage \
  AstraDB  and hybrid lexical and semantic retrieval with ai agent writers to generate a weekly \
  publication plan including all the headers seen in the example week found at ref/EESYSTEM \
  Publication Schedule.xlsx. The goal is to ultimately have a research, curation, analysis \
  engine, and a configured profile for EESystem brand that can be set to research and curate and \
  analyze daily while generating a full weekly publication schedule as seen in the ref example \
  autonomously. You will need to write prompts for each piece and leverage the knowledge base for\
   the brand and the knowledge base for the material. The application should have an attractive \
  yet simple interface that supports document upload, manual content generation, scheduling \
  preferences for the ai agents, and model selection via requesty.ai llm router (not the same api\
   as openai or claude, but supports both). Astra DB, by the way, handles embeddings \
  automatically and our platform should be designed to leverage this along with a robust hybrid \
  lexical and semantic retrieval system from the Astra DB Data API. We will also need \
  pre-processing and chunking for research content and uploads as well as reranking and whatnot. \
  Lastly, the system should have memory (short and longterm) using sqlite for short and astradb \
  for longterm (not just of conversations, but also of the content that was published). Use a \
  python backend with react frontend leveraging vite/typescript/tailwindcss/shadcn/ui and ensure \
  that volta is initialized out of the gate and that ts-node is configured, such that types can \
  be tested at each implementation step by the tester. You have a good crew. Lets get it done\
  **Strategy:** analysis - Data analysis with insights and visualization\
  **Coordination:** centralized - Single coordinator manages all agents\
  **Agents:** Up to 10 parallel agents\

  ## \uc0\u55357 \u56523  SPECIFIC ACTIONS FOR: Use an agentic swarm to research, plan, and create an application \
  that investigates and curates topics, trends and insights for content generation and strategic \
  messaging. We'll want configurable brands but for the initial one, lets do Energy Enhancement \
  System. We can use a variety of sources from the web as well as rss feeds and need to leverage \
  AstraDB  and hybrid lexical and semantic retrieval with ai agent writers to generate a weekly \
  publication plan including all the headers seen in the example week found at ref/EESYSTEM \
  Publication Schedule.xlsx. The goal is to ultimately have a research, curation, analysis \
  engine, and a configured profile for EESystem brand that can be set to research and curate and \
  analyze daily while generating a full weekly publication schedule as seen in the ref example \
  autonomously. You will need to write prompts for each piece and leverage the knowledge base for\
   the brand and the knowledge base for the material. The application should have an attractive \
  yet simple interface that supports document upload, manual content generation, scheduling \
  preferences for the ai agents, and model selection via requesty.ai llm router (not the same api\
   as openai or claude, but supports both). Astra DB, by the way, handles embeddings \
  automatically and our platform should be designed to leverage this along with a robust hybrid \
  lexical and semantic retrieval system from the Astra DB Data API. We will also need \
  pre-processing and chunking for research content and uploads as well as reranking and whatnot. \
  Lastly, the system should have memory (short and longterm) using sqlite for short and astradb \
  for longterm (not just of conversations, but also of the content that was published). Use a \
  python backend with react frontend leveraging vite/typescript/tailwindcss/shadcn/ui and ensure \
  that volta is initialized out of the gate and that ts-node is configured, such that types can \
  be tested at each implementation step by the tester. You have a good crew. Lets get it done\

  **Primary Tools for analysis:** Read (batch), Grep (parallel), Glob (parallel), Memory \
  (required), Task\
\
  ## \uc0\u55357 \u57000  CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTIONS\
\
  **EVERY AGENT IN THE SWARM MUST:**\
\
  1. **USE BATCH TOOLS EXCLUSIVELY**\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Reading files one by one with multiple Read calls\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Reading all files in ONE Read operation with array of paths\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Multiple Edit calls for different files\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Single MultiEdit call with all file changes\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Sequential Grep searches\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Parallel Glob/Grep operations\
\
  2. **SAVE DETAILED SUMMARIES TO MEMORY**\
     Each agent MUST store comprehensive summaries:\
     ```javascript\
     // Example for researcher agent\
     Memory.store("swarm-analysis-centralized-1751831097862/researcher/framework-analysis", \{\
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\
       agent: "researcher_1",\
       task: "Analyze web frameworks",\
       findings: \{\
         frameworks: ["React", "Vue", "Angular"],\
         comparisons: \{ /* detailed data */ \},\
         recommendations: "React for this use case because..."\
       \},\
       sources: ["urls", "docs"],\
       nextSteps: ["Implement prototype", "Performance testing"]\
     \});\
     ```\
\
  3. **COORDINATE THROUGH MEMORY**\
     - Check Memory for related work before starting\
     - Store progress updates during execution\
     - Save final results with clear structure\
     - Reference other agents' Memory entries\
\
  Remember: You're orchestrating a **analysis swarm** with **centralized coordination**. \
  Use Task() to spawn specialized agents, batch tools for efficiency, and Memory for all \
  coordination and results.\

  - **Task**: Agent spawning and management\
\
  ## Configuration\
  - **Batch Optimized**: Yes\
  - **Coordination Mode**: Standard\
  - **Max Parallel Tasks**: Unlimited\
\
  ## Usage Pattern\
  ```javascript\
  // Use TodoWrite for task coordination\
  TodoWrite([\
    \{\
      id: "analyzer_task",\
      content: "Execute analyzer task with batch optimization",\
      status: "pending",\
      priority: "high",\
      mode: "analyzer",\
      batchOptimized: true,\
      tools: ["Read","Grep","Bash","Write","Memory","TodoWrite","Task"]\
    \}\
  ]);\
  // Launch specialized agent\
  Task("Analyzer Agent", "Execute specialized analyzer task", \{\
    mode: "analyzer",\
    batchOptimized: true,\
    memoryIntegration: true\
  \});\
  ```\
\
  ## Best Practices\
  - Use batch operations when working with multiple files\
  - Store intermediate results in Memory for coordination\
  - Enable parallel execution for independent tasks\
  - Monitor resource usage during intensive operations\
\
  ## Integration Capabilities\
  This mode integrates with:\
  - Memory system for state persistence\
  - TodoWrite/TodoRead for task coordination\
  - Task tool for agent spawning\
  - Batch file operations for efficiency\
  - Real-time monitoring and metrics\
\
  ## Instructions\
  You MUST use the above tools, follow the best practices, and implement the usage patterns specified for the analyzer mode. Execute all tasks using batch operations when possible\
   and coordinate through TodoWrite/Memory as appropriate.\
\
  ## OBJECTIVE: Use an agentic swarm to research, plan, and create an application that investigates and curates topics, trends and insights for content generation and strategic \
  messaging. We'll want configurable brands but for the initial one, lets do Energy Enhancement System. We can use a variety of sources from the web as well as rss feeds and need \
  to leverage AstraDB  and hybrid lexical and semantic retrieval with ai agent writers to generate a weekly publication plan including all the headers seen in the example week \
  found at ref/EESYSTEM Publication Schedule.xlsx. The goal is to ultimately have a research, curation, analysis engine, and a configured profile for EESystem brand that can be \
  set to research and curate and analyze daily while generating a full weekly publication schedule as seen in the ref example autonomously. You will need to write prompts for each\
   piece and leverage the knowledge base for the brand and the knowledge base for the material. The application should have an attractive yet simple interface that supports \
  document upload, manual content generation, scheduling preferences for the ai agents, and model selection via requesty.ai llm router (not the same api as openai or claude, but \
  supports both). Astra DB, by the way, handles embeddings automatically and our platform should be designed to leverage this along with a robust hybrid lexical and semantic \
  retrieval system from the Astra DB Data API. We will also need pre-processing and chunking for research content and uploads as well as reranking and whatnot. Lastly, the system \
  should have memory (short and longterm) using sqlite for short and astradb for longterm (not just of conversations, but also of the content that was published). Use a python \
  backend with react frontend leveraging vite/typescript/tailwindcss/shadcn/ui and ensure that volta is initialized out of the gate and that ts-node is configured, such that types\
   can be tested at each implementation step by the tester. You have a good crew. Lets get it done\

   and need to leverage AstraDB  and hybrid lexical and semantic retrieval with ai agent writers to generate a weekly publication plan including all the headers seen in the \
  example week found at ref/EESYSTEM Publication Schedule.xlsx. The goal is to ultimately have a research, curation, analysis engine, and a configured profile for EESystem brand \
  that can be set to research and curate and analyze daily while generating a full weekly publication schedule as seen in the ref example autonomously. You will need to write \
  prompts for each piece and leverage the knowledge base for the brand and the knowledge base for the material. The application should have an attractive yet simple interface that\
   supports document upload, manual content generation, scheduling preferences for the ai agents, and model selection via requesty.ai llm router (not the same api as openai or \
  claude, but supports both). Astra DB, by the way, handles embeddings automatically and our platform should be designed to leverage this along with a robust hybrid lexical and \
  semantic retrieval system from the Astra DB Data API. We will also need pre-processing and chunking for research content and uploads as well as reranking and whatnot. Lastly, \
  the system should have memory (short and longterm) using sqlite for short and astradb for longterm (not just of conversations, but also of the content that was published). Use a\
   python backend with react frontend leveraging vite/typescript/tailwindcss/shadcn/ui and ensure that volta is initialized out of the gate and that ts-node is configured, such \
  that types can be tested at each implementation step by the tester. You have a good crew. Lets get it done\
  **Strategy:** analysis - Data analysis with insights and visualization\
  **Coordination:** centralized - Single coordinator manages all agents\
  **Agents:** Up to 10 parallel agents\

  lexical and semantic retrieval system from the Astra DB Data API. We will also need pre-processing and chunking for research content and uploads as well as reranking and \
  whatnot. Lastly, the system should have memory (short and longterm) using sqlite for short and astradb for longterm (not just of conversations, but also of the content that was \
  published). Use a python backend with react frontend leveraging vite/typescript/tailwindcss/shadcn/ui and ensure that volta is initialized out of the gate and that ts-node is \

  ## \uc0\u9989  SUCCESS METRICS\
\
  **The swarm succeeds when:**\
  - Use an agentic swarm to research, plan, and create an application that investigates and curates topics, trends and insights for content generation and strategic messaging. \
  We'll want configurable brands but for the initial one, lets do Energy Enhancement System. We can use a variety of sources from the web as well as rss feeds and need to leverage\
   AstraDB  and hybrid lexical and semantic retrieval with ai agent writers to generate a weekly publication plan including all the headers seen in the example week found at \
  ref/EESYSTEM Publication Schedule.xlsx. The goal is to ultimately have a research, curation, analysis engine, and a configured profile for EESystem brand that can be set to \
  research and curate and analyze daily while generating a full weekly publication schedule as seen in the ref example autonomously. You will need to write prompts for each piece \
  and leverage the knowledge base for the brand and the knowledge base for the material. The application should have an attractive yet simple interface that supports document \

  - All agents have contributed concrete deliverables\
  - Results are consolidated in Memory\
  - Final output directly addresses "Use an agentic swarm to research, plan, and create an application that investigates and curates topics, trends and insights for content \

\
  **Primary Tools for analysis:** Read (batch), Grep (parallel), Glob (parallel), Memory (required), Task\
\
  ## \uc0\u55357 \u57000  CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTIONS\
\
  **EVERY AGENT IN THE SWARM MUST:**\
\
  1. **USE BATCH TOOLS EXCLUSIVELY**\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Reading files one by one with multiple Read calls\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Reading all files in ONE Read operation with array of paths\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Multiple Edit calls for different files\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Single MultiEdit call with all file changes\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Sequential Grep searches\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Parallel Glob/Grep operations\
\
  2. **SAVE DETAILED SUMMARIES TO MEMORY**\
     Each agent MUST store comprehensive summaries:\
     ```javascript\
     // Example for researcher agent\
     Memory.store("swarm-analysis-centralized-1751831097862/researcher/framework-analysis", \{\
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\
       agent: "researcher_1",\
       task: "Analyze web frameworks",\
       findings: \{\
         frameworks: ["React", "Vue", "Angular"],\
         comparisons: \{ /* detailed data */ \},\
         recommendations: "React for this use case because..."\
       \},\
       sources: ["urls", "docs"],\
       nextSteps: ["Implement prototype", "Performance testing"]\
     \});\
     ```\
\
  3. **COORDINATE THROUGH MEMORY**\
     - Check Memory for related work before starting\
     - Store progress updates during execution\
     - Save final results with clear structure\
     - Reference other agents' Memory entries\
\
  Remember: You're orchestrating a **analysis swarm** with **centralized coordination**. \
  Use Task() to spawn specialized agents, batch tools for efficiency, and Memory for all coordination and results.\

\
      1. Enhanced AuthContext (Frontend)\
        - JWT token management with automatic refresh\
        - User state persistence with localStorage/sessionStorage\
        - Role-based permission checking\
        - Login/logout functionality\
        - Registration and password reset flows\
      2. Backend Auth Enhancement\
        - JWT token generation and validation\
        - Refresh token rotation\
        - Password hashing with bcrypt\
        - Rate limiting for auth endpoints\
        - Session blacklisting for logout\
      3. Auth Middleware & Route Protection\
        - Frontend protected routes with React Router\
        - Backend middleware for API protection\
        - Role-based access control (RBAC)\
        - Permission decorators for endpoints\
        - Auth state synchronization\
      4. User Management System\
        - User registration with email verification\
        - Password reset with email tokens\
        - Profile management\
        - Role assignment (Admin, Editor, Viewer)\
        - Activity logging and audit trails\
      5. Security Features\
        - CSRF protection\
        - XSS prevention\
        - Secure cookie configuration\
        - Rate limiting and brute force protection\
        - Session security and timeout\
\
      INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:\

  - **Task**: Agent spawning and management\
\
  ## Configuration\
  - **Batch Optimized**: Yes\
  - **Coordination Mode**: Standard\
  - **Max Parallel Tasks**: Unlimited\
\
  ## Usage Pattern\
  ```javascript\
  // Use TodoWrite for task coordination\
  TodoWrite([\
    \{\
      id: "analyzer_task",\
      content: "Execute analyzer task with batch optimization",\
      status: "pending",\
      priority: "high",\
      mode: "analyzer",\
      batchOptimized: true,\
      tools: ["Read","Grep","Bash","Write","Memory","TodoWrite","Task"]\
    \}\
  ]);\
  // Launch specialized agent\
  Task("Analyzer Agent", "Execute specialized analyzer task", \{\
    mode: "analyzer",\
    batchOptimized: true,\
    memoryIntegration: true\
  \});\
  ```\
\
  ## Best Practices\
  - Use batch operations when working with multiple files\
  - Store intermediate results in Memory for coordination\
  - Enable parallel execution for independent tasks\
  - Monitor resource usage during intensive operations\
\
  ## Integration Capabilities\
  This mode integrates with:\
  - Memory system for state persistence\
  - TodoWrite/TodoRead for task coordination\
  - Task tool for agent spawning\
  - Batch file operations for efficiency\
  - Real-time monitoring and metrics\
\
  ## Instructions\
  You MUST use the above tools, follow the best practices, and implement the usage patterns specified for the analyzer mode. Execute all tasks using batch operations when possible\
   and coordinate through TodoWrite/Memory as appropriate.\
\
  ## OBJECTIVE: Use an agentic swarm to research, plan, and create an application that investigates and curates topics, trends and insights for content generation and strategic \
  messaging. We'll want configurable brands but for the initial one, lets do Energy Enhancement System. We can use a variety of sources from the web as well as rss feeds and need \
  to leverage AstraDB  and hybrid lexical and semantic retrieval with ai agent writers to generate a weekly publication plan including all the headers seen in the example week \
  found at ref/EESYSTEM Publication Schedule.xlsx. The goal is to ultimately have a research, curation, analysis engine, and a configured profile for EESystem brand that can be \
  set to research and curate and analyze daily while generating a full weekly publication schedule as seen in the ref example autonomously. You will need to write prompts for each\
   piece and leverage the knowledge base for the brand and the knowledge base for the material. The application should have an attractive yet simple interface that supports \
  document upload, manual content generation, scheduling preferences for the ai agents, and model selection via requesty.ai llm router (not the same api as openai or claude, but \
  supports both). Astra DB, by the way, handles embeddings automatically and our platform should be designed to leverage this along with a robust hybrid lexical and semantic \
  retrieval system from the Astra DB Data API. We will also need pre-processing and chunking for research content and uploads as well as reranking and whatnot. Lastly, the system \
  should have memory (short and longterm) using sqlite for short and astradb for longterm (not just of conversations, but also of the content that was published). Use a python \
  backend with react frontend leveraging vite/typescript/tailwindcss/shadcn/ui and ensure that volta is initialized out of the gate and that ts-node is configured, such that types\
   can be tested at each implementation step by the tester. You have a good crew. Lets get it done\

  **Primary Tools for analysis:** Read (batch), Grep (parallel), Glob (parallel), Memory (required), Task\
\
  ## \uc0\u55357 \u57000  CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTIONS\
\
  **EVERY AGENT IN THE SWARM MUST:**\
\
  1. **USE BATCH TOOLS EXCLUSIVELY**\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Reading files one by one with multiple Read calls\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Reading all files in ONE Read operation with array of paths\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Multiple Edit calls for different files\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Single MultiEdit call with all file changes\
     - \uc0\u10060  WRONG: Sequential Grep searches\
     - \uc0\u9989  RIGHT: Parallel Glob/Grep operations\
\
  2. **SAVE DETAILED SUMMARIES TO MEMORY**\
     Each agent MUST store comprehensive summaries:\
     ```javascript\
     // Example for researcher agent\
     Memory.store("swarm-analysis-centralized-1751831097862/researcher/framework-analysis", \{\
       timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),\
       agent: "researcher_1",\
       task: "Analyze web frameworks",\
       findings: \{\
         frameworks: ["React", "Vue", "Angular"],\
         comparisons: \{ /* detailed data */ \},\
         recommendations: "React for this use case because..."\
       \},\
       sources: ["urls", "docs"],\
       nextSteps: ["Implement prototype", "Performance testing"]\
     \});\
     ```\
\
  3. **COORDINATE THROUGH MEMORY**\
     - Check Memory for related work before starting\
     - Store progress updates during execution\
     - Save final results with clear structure\
     - Reference other agents' Memory entries\
\
  Remember: You're orchestrating a **analysis swarm** with **centralized coordination**. \
  Use Task() to spawn specialized agents, batch tools for efficiency, and Memory for all coordination and results.\
